{"artist-name": "Caroline Polachek", "album-name": "Pang", "abstract": "The former Chairlift singer-songwriter centers her sweeping solo debut on her powerful voice, crafting love songs about the moment of surrender, the pain preceding it, and the euphoria after.", "body": "<div class=\"contents dropcap\"><p>Caroline Polachek named her album <em>Pang</em> after the bursts of adrenaline that jolted her out of sleep. She describes this as an internal thing, the sudden shock of emotion that \u201c<a href=\"https://popcrush.com/caroline-polachek-interview-2019-so-hot-youre-hurting-my-feelings/\">pricks you emotionally from the inside</a>.\u201d But it\u2019s corporeal, too; you can\u2019t say the word \u201cpang\u201d\u2014or sing it, as Polachek does on the title track\u2014without a quick release of breath, somewhere between a gasp and a sigh.</p>\n<p><em>Pang</em> is Polachek\u2019s first album under her own name (she released 2014\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19287-ramona-lisa-arcadia/\">Arcadia</a></em> as Ramona Lisa, and 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22822-drawing-the-target-around-the-arrow/\">Drawing the Target Around the Arrow</a></em> as her initials, CEP) and perhaps not coincidentally, this album centers on her vocals. The music doesn\u2019t depart too far from her work in <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/\">Chairlift</a>: a little <em><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22976-tango-in-the-night-deluxe-edition/\">Tango in the Night</a></em> sophistipop, a little ambient, and a little from the charts. Her usual lyrical themes recur: living unexpected dreams, getting away with something sneaky-fun, tears <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ3h0ZA3FQ0\">in public</a> and in oceans. There\u2019s also that familiar tension between the anonymity of the city and the pastoral, even suburban; on \u201cParachute,\u201d Polachek sings about love as a force pulling her \u201cback to strip malls, highways, and treetops.\u201d The scope of <em>Pang</em>, however, is wider.</p>\n<p>She produced much of the album with PC Music\u2019s <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/artists/32521-danny-l-harle/\">Danny L Harle</a>, and massively tones down his fripperies. At times, there\u2019s a new age or modern classical tinge to the arrangements. Sometimes <em>Pang</em> sounds so sweeping it\u2019s almost symphonic; the first few notes of \u201cThe Gate\u201d almost sound like a synthetic orchestra tuning up. It\u2019s a PR clich\u00e9 to tout artists\u2019 \u201cclassical training,\u201d which can mean anything from actual classical training to a semester of voice lessons in college, but in her work, you genuinely can hear it. She\u2019s mentioned writing melodies as wordless stretches of singing\u2014she calls it \u201capplesaucing.\u201d For most of the decade, she\u2019s taken classical voice lessons, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA2z-d1l99o\">specifically in baroque</a> singing. This comes out not just in the soaring, near-operatic vocalizations throughout <em>Pang</em>, but in the crisp way she attacks words and syllables, the controlled vocal leaps, and precise staccato.</p>\n<p>Even more specifically, Polachek took up opera lessons after hearing the version of Handel\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3jKITkJvE0\">Lascia ch\u2019io pianga</a>\u201d in Lars von Trier\u2019s <em>Antichrist</em>. The non-traditional recording perhaps inspired her to use her training to non-traditional ends. Melodies that are heavily vocoded or Auto-Tuned often sound a little like a machine-made baroque run. As Polachek <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/18650/1/young-turks-2-caroline-polachek-sings-a-handel-aria\">put it</a>, \u201cthe voice just becomes the ultimate analog synth,\u201d and it\u2019s an effect she goes for a lot: the ornamentation throughout \u201cInsomnia\u201d and \u201cHey Big Eyes,\u201d the digitally augmented glissando on the \u201cOcean of Tears\u201d chorus, or the tumble of a vocal run, almost like a guitar solo, from the bridge of \u201cSo Hot You\u2019re Hurting My Feelings.\u201d The influence also filters into the instrumental at times, most clearly the harpsichord-esque notes that underpin \u201cHey Big Eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Pang</em> is such a coherent musical statement that when something doesn\u2019t fit, it stands out. Polachek restructured the album <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/10/15/caroline-polachek-pang-interview\">somewhat late</a>, swapping out five songs; what\u2019s left is a sweeping, delicately latticed album with a few odd pop songs. They\u2019re not <em>bad</em> pop songs. \u201cNew Normal\u201d matches quick-cut lyrical scenes with a chameleonic arrangement: Polachek\u2019s melody is yanked between two keys, and the instrumental goes from a conspicuously yeehaw opening of slide guitar to an almost dancehall beat to sputtering percussion and vocal clips from hip-hop. Somehow, it all works, but it belongs to an entirely different record. The Andrew Wyatt co-write \u201cHit Me Where It Hurts\u201d feels like it was intended for <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/\">Charli XCX</a>\u2014the low, throaty, near-spoken verses are drastically unlike Polachek\u2019s vocal arrangements throughout <em>Pang</em>, but very much something Charli might handle.</p>\n<p>What those five new songs\u2014\u201cThe Gate,\u201d \u201cPang,\u201d \u201cOcean of Tears,\u201d \u201cCaroline Shut Up,\u201d and \u201cSo Hot You\u2019re Hurting My Feelings\u201d\u2014do have in common is that they\u2019re all love songs about the moment of surrender, the pain preceding it, and the euphoria after. These are something Polachek\u2019s said she\u2019s hesitant to write. Whether this is true\u2014after all, this is the singer of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e8Ql9qFA2o\">I Belong In Your Arms</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ3h0ZA3FQ0\">Crying in Public</a>,\u201d two of the decade\u2019s most unabashed love songs\u2014one still detects a certain wryness on <em>Pang</em>. \u201cCaroline Shut Up\u201d is the record\u2019s most swooning track, a waltz-tempo love ballad. The title is what she shouts at herself, an exasperated reminder to stop overthinking lest she ruin the moment. She gets punchy and self-mocking in \u201cSo Hot You\u2019re Hurting My Feelings.\u201d The arrangement is \u201980s, somewhere between \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs\">Every Breath You Take</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLSUDSNqLgQ\">Everywhere</a>,\u201d but the scene is \u201910s: crying in public over the Snaps you\u2019re getting from your long-distance partner, culminating in the goofy-horny \u201cshow me the banana.\u201d The chorus is punctuated, louder each time, with a gasp: the sound of a crush so sudden you feel like running out of the room, or bursting into a grin and never stopping. After all, laughter is a pang too.</p>\n</div>"},
{"artist-name": "Vagabon", "album-name": "Vagabon", "abstract": "On her self-titled sophomore effort, Laetitia Tamko leaps with both feet into new sounds and new horizons.", "body": "<div class=\"contents dropcap\"><p>In crafting her self-titled sophomore album, Laetitia Tamko (aka Vagabon) was hyper-cognizant of how the context around her had changed. The unexpected success of her 2017 debut <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22921-vagabon-infinite-worlds/\"><em>Infinite Worlds</em></a> meant more resources at her fingertips, but also heightened scrutiny from a public that so often defaults to consuming black women as prophets of oppression and pain. \u201cI was growing really weary of black sadness and seeing how it\u2019s consumed,\u201d the Cameroon-born artist said earlier this year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to romanticize being tortured.\u201d she told <em>Pitchfork</em>.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, Tamko was folded into the ongoing conversation about the scarcity of visible black women in indie rock\u2014the only world she has known as a practicing musician, having emerged in New York City alongside artists like <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/\">Frankie Cosmos</a>. She could have dug her heels deeper into the sound that first won her acclaim, but <em>Vagabon</em> is instead a bracing departure, wielding digital sounds and strings alongside her familiar, delicate guitar in search of wider worlds.</p>\n<p>Tamko produced the album herself and played most of it, and you notice immediately that her voice is subtly foregrounded. The beckoning whisper of <em>Infinite Worlds</em> has become rounder and more confident. This new boldness is matched by her production, which toggles between small-room intimacy and cathedral-sized grandeur. Tamko plays with all kinds of new palettes here, showing impressive mastery over them. On \u201cFlood\u201d and \u201cWater Me Down,\u201d she subsumes the bombast of \u201980s and \u201990s new wave into her quietly insightful writing. The heartbreaking \u201cIn A Bind\u201d combines her tiptoeing acoustic guitar with a gospel choir and new age, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTrk4X9ACtw\">Orinoco Flow</a>\u201d-esque synth tones.</p>\n<p>Throughout most of <em>Vagabon</em>, Tamko is not shouting to a crowd, but addressing one specific \u201cyou,\u201d reassuring them of her love, pleading for them to stay, questioning their permanence, all in service of her own self-determinism. \u201cI belong to no one/You tried hard to be mine/I won\u2019t ask permission from you/We reserve the right to be full when we\u2019re on our own,\u201d she sings on \u201cEvery Woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tamko\u2019s adventurousness is admirable, both lyrically and sonically, but occasionally the intimacy of her writing is overwhelmed by her surroundings. The layered arrangement of \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Leave the Table\u201d feels muddled, which obscures the simple, evocative chorus: \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave the table I\u2019m still eating.\u201d It\u2019s a rare misstep on an album that otherwise uses restraint to its advantage.</p>\n<p>With its opening and closing tracks, <em>Vagabon</em> forms a sort of self-comforting loop. \u201cFull Moon in Gemini (Monako Reprise)\u201d takes the album\u2019s opening track and tones it an octave down, turning the song from bright and hopeful to easy and accepting. The closed circle feels like a protective gesture, an act of will, a way to book-end her growth and frame it on her terms.  With that transformation, <em>Vagabon</em> concludes as a work of not only personal self-discovery, but evolution in real time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Buy: <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8984099/type/dlg/sid/reviewvagabonvagabon/https://www.roughtrade.com/us/vagabon/all-the-women-in-me\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rough Trade</a> / <a href=\"https://vinyl-me-please.evyy.net/Ev1N9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vinyl Me, Please</a></p>\n<p><em>(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)</em></p>\n</div>"}
